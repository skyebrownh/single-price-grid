## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to use the shorthand for `border-radius` to streamline my CSS. This shorthand is not as straightforward as others like `border` or `margin` so it was helpful to learn how it works (see resource below for a more detailed explanation).

### Continued development

I hope to get more practice with CSS Grid and how it applies to more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Border Radius](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-radius/) - A helpful resource on `border-radius` including how the shorthand property works.
